Born in 1974, Dr. Yener Demirtaş is a plastic surgeon who has completed her education in the most prestigious universities in Turkey and the world. He has nearly one hundred international publications, over one hundred international speeches, and over ten international awards.

Dr. Demirtaş has been dealing with lipoedema treatment for 15 years. During this period, all known liposuction methods such as dry, superdry, wet (wet), superwet, tumescent, WAL (water assisted liposuction), UAL (ultrasound assisted liposuction), PAL (power assisted liposuction), laser liposuction tried and despite the good results he achieved, he was not satisfied and always continued his search. Dr. Demirtaş has been using the "Lymph Protective VASER Liposuction" method, which he developed for the treatment of lipoedema for 8 years, which he believes is the best for today. However, he continues his search for the perfect technique without getting tired.

Dr. Demirtaş has devoted himself completely to the treatment of patients with lipedema in the last ten years and only operates on patients with lipedema. The basis of the surgeries is body shaping with “Lymph-Sparing VASER Liposuction”. Interventions such as abdomen, arm, thigh lift surgeries, breast reduction, fat injections, breast augmentation or facial rejuvenation are applied in the same session in required patients.
