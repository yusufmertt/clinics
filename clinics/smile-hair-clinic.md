An Accelerated Journey Started by Two Perfectionists! It all started with Dr. M. Erdogan and Dr. G. Bilgin’s passion for advancement in hair transplantation. Devoting years of experience to FUE hair transplantation techniques, two perfectionists showed their difference in hair transplantation by establishing of Smile Hair Clinic in 2018. Since then, Smile Hair Clinic has been a global benchmark for best-in-class medical hair transplantation clinics in the region.
